Greetings!

ðŸ“„ About This Project

This is a landing page designed for the "Speak Up" microcourse as part of the Scoreazy internship assignment. It highlights the key benefits of the course, testimonials, FAQs, and includes a responsive form â€” all styled with a consistent teal-themed UI.

ðŸ’» How to View the Website

1. You do not need any software or installation. Follow these steps:
2. Download the folder (if accessing from Google Drive or as a ZIP).
3. Unzip the folder if it's compressed.
4. Inside the folder, look for a file named index.html.
5. Double-click on index.html â€” it will open in your default web browser.
6. Make sure all files (like style.css, images, .json/.gif) stay in the same folder â€” do not move them around.
